,Critics Reviews,Rotten/Fresh
0,"Subtitled Murder, Mayhem and Madness, Tiger King delivers the latter two Ms in spades and it proves instantly gripping.",fresh
1,"...the documentary is too swept up by Exotic's point-scoring against Baskin, and loses sight of its original purpose, the animals supposedly at its centre.",rotten
2,"Enthralling in an aghast kind of way, like watching an accident in slow-mo - but not even that interesting an accident - a collision between two old milk floats, say, where you're just left with much broken glass and a rancid pungency.",rotten
3,"It's a highly watchable docu-series, with insights into the grandiose delusions of self-made celebrities in the internet age. The Tiger King and I... lets some of the doc's subjects keep soaking up attention... without any reasoned objections.",fresh
4,"The storyline is eye-poppingly bizarre, not to mention grotesque, but do I really need to endure more than the two episodes I've so far spent in the company of Joe Exotic, Doc Antle and other ghastly people?",rotten
5,"Just like Tiger King, The Tiger King and I is messy... But it rightfully shifts focus to the real heroes of the story - the underpaid zookeepers who seem to be the only people who actually care about the animals' wellbeing.",fresh
6,"As shocking and sobering as it is pure entertainment, Tiger King is must-see TV.",fresh
7,"I learned a few ugly yet important truths that make ""Tiger King"" worthwhile.",fresh
8,"Tiger King grabs your attention from the get-go and keeps you hooked with its constant refreshing of information, facts and conspiracy theories, some of which you'd dismiss as crazy were it not for the assurance that it's all true, more or less.",fresh
9,"There's nothing in directors' Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin's seven-episode documentary series that would look out of place in American Vandal, the definitive true-crime documentary parody.",rotten
10,Tiger King is at its core a deeply stained product of an infotainment America where clown car drivers of both parties are at the helm of a clearly crashing caravan of state and a loose relationship with the truth and facts is a new normal.,rotten
11,"Sensational murder-for-hire docu is chaotic, profane.",fresh
12,"The series is a carnival sideshow not unlike Joe Exotic's central-Oklahoma park: You see the sign on the side of the road and you stop, not because you want to, necessarily, but because it's there.",rotten
13,WTF,fresh
14,"By deliberately seducing the viewer with an all-pervasive portrait of human nature, Tiger King proves that there's no bigger oxymoron in the English language than ""human nature"".",fresh
15,"Tiger King is not what I'd call nutritious viewing. Most of the people in it are horrible, though you may feel yourself drawn (as I did) to rooting for one abominable side over another. But the show is fascinatingly American.",fresh
16,"A weird mix of fortune, glory, death, secrets, and tigers in captivity. [Full review in Spanish].",fresh
17,"Tiger King is seven episodes of pure, chaotic fun. Having something new to watch, especially on a streamer that many people might consider a primary platform, feels like a luxury.",fresh
18,"The troubling narrative is an uneven mess that glosses over the issues of animal neglect and abuse, very real issues anyone with decent eyesight observes behind the madness, to focus on the glaringly outsized personalities at the fore.",rotten
19,"...as you watch the years-in-the-making documentary from co-directors Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin, you'll be shocked at just how weird this tale manages to become.",fresh
20,Directors Rebecca Chaiklin and Eric Goode have taken this sordid tale and crafted an experience so compelling it's nearly impossible not to want to watch the whole thing in one sitting.,fresh
21,Must see TV.,fresh
22,A compelling series in fits and starts that doesn't amount to much more than a trip through an extremely strange world filled with extremely strange people.,fresh
23,"A menagerie of human grotesqueries, like a car crash you just can't look away from. Part reality show, part true crime investigation, all batpoop-crazy.",fresh
24,Less a documentary than a cornucopia of absurdity -- like directors Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin are slipping drugs into our feeds... Thankfully the series gets by on more than simple shock value.,fresh
25,"In the end this is dreadfully similar to a visit to a zoo: the documentary is entertaining, in part fascinating, but it makes you wonder whether it's morally justifiable to watch a show with animals locked in cages. [Full review in Spanish]",fresh
26,"Scratch beneath the veneer of its sneering Christopher-Guest-goes-to-the-trailer-park milieu and Tiger King proves to be lazy at best, morally corrupt at worst.",rotten
27,"This is Shakespearian fare - a fantastic collision between obsessions, riches and vanity - all under a tiger-print banner.",fresh
28,Tiger King sells itself on its increasingly bizarre twists.,fresh
29,"It was one of those shows you hungrily watched, only to realise you'd learnt almost nothing.",fresh
30,The very best thing about Tiger King is its endless supply of bombs... that it drops on you exactly when you are starting to think that this whole world couldn't possibly get any stranger.,fresh
31,"It's incredibly compelling, and terribly so: Tiger King is almost wholly dedicated to spectacle, with little interest in any sense of truth. And the truth is about as gutting as Tiger King is sensational.",fresh
32,"Why, Lord, couldn't Cheer, Netflix's rousing and triumphant docuseries about college cheerleaders, have debuted this week?",rotten
33,"A Shakespearian tragedy fitting for this dystopian modern era, Tiger King finds a sense of mesmerizing beauty in its perpetual race down the gutter.",fresh
34,"A strange, intriguing, and disturbing documentary series. [Full Review in Spanish]",fresh
35,"""Liars, and ligers, and bears, oh my what a delirious freak show is Netflix's true crime sensation Tiger King.",fresh
36,"To call it bizarre would be an understatement, and to say it is hard to stop watching, would be putting this binge-worthy series, lightly. In fact, one would need many, many words to describe this manner of crime and showboating.",fresh
37,"In anxious, pandemic times, a brief encounter with the truly weird is catharsis, a kind of cleansing experience.",fresh
38,"""Tiger King"" aims to be lurid in every second of its existence, and it hits the mark squarely and often.",fresh
39,"Told you it was bonkers. But, paradoxically, it's for that reason that Tiger King did absolutely nothing to change my opinion of the grossly exploitative nature of true-crime.",rotten
40,"Whatever your reservations about the docuseries' ethics, Tiger King is perfectly engineered to be mass consumed by a bored, quarantined populace thirsty for salacious content to make memes about.",fresh
41,It's a tiger of a tale; exotic is an understatement.,fresh
42,"""Tiger King"" is so batshit, it could be a parody.",fresh
43,"The show has an irresistible pull, with its eccentric cast and escalating series of events. It's too bad it didn't do more with the story besides just hacking it up and throwing bloody chunks at ravenous Netflix viewers.",rotten
44,"It is the best sort of crowd-pleasing documentary, titillating yet sweeping in its scope and the breadth of its amazing access and elaborate story building.",fresh
45,"It's a lot to unpack, and I highly recommend you watch it because it is 100% gold entertainment.",fresh
46,"As satisfying, depressing, and compelling the human stories of Tiger King are, how they parallel this moment in history is what makes it a worthy ascendant into the pantheon of cultural touchstones.",fresh
47,The show is a cautionary tale of letting those feuds and escalations get out of control.,fresh
48,"Tiger King is the first great fictional unifier of the coronavirus age. Ironically, however, it is about a stratum of society that could be partially blamed for the apocalypse that we currently find ourselves engulfed by - politically and environmentally.",fresh
49,"Netflix's Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness about tiger enthusiast, Joe Exotic, is a must see for lovers of true crime, Grey Gardens, or early aughts soap opera Passions.",fresh
50,"While Tiger King may be comfort food on TV for some, it brings me little comfort. I get why you like it, but I don't get why you like it.",rotten
51,"Tiger King exposes the furry underbelly of a big-cat community I'd never known about, in which the lines between loving wild animals and exploiting them are never quite clear. In the end, I felt queasy at what I had seen, but the time sure had flown.",fresh
52,A compelling true-crime story full of shocks.,fresh
53,"Nothing in this-not the bad clothes, the bad haircuts, the lamentable life choices-suggests an origin here on Earth. Or maybe I just need to get out more.",fresh
54,"While true crime generally rules Netflix, Tiger King is really something else-a series with the goal to entertain its viewers with its win-at-all-costs battle for a kingdom.",fresh
55,"Just when you think you know exactly what is happening, it takes a quick turn to one side - getting crazier & crazier. And when it ends? You will be begging for a season two.",fresh
56,"Among the series' endless qualities, the vivacity of the characters towers above all. Every one of these insanely idiosyncratic individuals feels like they're being played by the world's greatest character actor giving their career-best performance.",fresh
57,"If you are a fan of documents centered around the darkest side of the country of opportunities, you better watch this. [Full Review in Spanish]",fresh
58,"The characters are larger than life, their backstories are often heartbreaking, their motivations and actions are highly questionable -- sometimes flat-out criminal -- and the trajectory of the story is never remotely predictable.",fresh
59,Tiger King is genuinely compulsive viewing.,fresh
60,"In this wild ride viewers are made to bear witness to what can be destroyed and thwarted when an obsession with profit is placed in front of the needs of people and nature, with lots of melodrama in the mix.",fresh
61,"These people are a trip, and you walk away not really rooting for anyone, and dying for a sequel, because there are so many unanswered questions, and unindicted a*sholes who should be in jail.",fresh
62,"The greatest showcase of untamed personalities ever ... as the series goes on, the outlandish cast stacks up, curiouser and curiouser.",fresh
63,"By the end, I was rooting for pretty much everyone to be eaten by a tiger.",fresh
64,"Tiger King has enough insanity, intrigue, and politics to distract even the busiest minds from your worries - unless you're worried about being mauled by a tiger.",fresh
65,"What's particularly great is how cleverly structured it is. Just when you feel you know where the story is going - and, you know, have a good idea of the rights and wrongs - the makers love nothing more than to pull the rug from right underneath you.",fresh
66,Tiger King is utterly compelling but it's also infuriating and astonishing in equal measure. It's a masterful piece of storytelling.,fresh
67,"Tiger King is one wild adventure, and I cannot recommend it enough. Every person on-screen, from groundskeepers to the woman who spilled to details about Antle's imposed working conditions, is a force of nature.",fresh
68,"At first glance, Tiger King may look like another Fyre Fest-esque documentary ... but audiences should prepare themselves for some deeply distressing moments of darkness.",fresh
69,"What Tiger King does best is illustrate how good intentions can turn into obsessions, how personal vendettas can take over your mind, and the dangers of people who inexorably draw others close to them, spinning them inexorably into their lives.",fresh
70,Tiger King doesn't quite manage to achieve any of its possible aims... But it's an undeniably entertaining look into an epic American yarn that seems far too strange to not be fiction.,fresh
71,"""Tiger King"" manages to tell an electrifying story with an open mind, a shrewd eye, and a delicate touch.",fresh
72,"The series is both a sad, sordid tale of the corrosive effects of vengeance and a fascinating look at an enigmatic yet undeniably magnetic subculture.",fresh
73,"Tiger King is nuts, but it's a good nuts.",fresh
74,"The documentary does struggle from a lack of focus and an overly packed finale, but it's still well worth a look for true crime fans hungry for something different.",fresh
75,"The outlandish world presented by Tiger King is funny, gross, frustrating, contemplative, and ultimately sympathetic. This is a story of animals, yes, but it's also a story of what makes us human.",fresh
76,"For those who love Netflix's particular flavor of true crime and docuseries, which depend heavily on wild characters and addictive pacing in order to keep a couchbound audience entertained, Tiger King will undoubtedly scratch a particular itch.",fresh
77,"Tiger King is so awash in hard-to-believe oddballs that lean into their image it genuinely feels like a Coen brothers movie come to life, the kind of thing any studio would return to the writer saying the screenplay was too over the top.",fresh
78,Goode knows that he has a central character to rule them all in Joe Exotic...,fresh
79,Tiger King depicts a captivating power hungry game the likes of which you haven't seen since Scorsese's gangster movies.,fresh
80,"Tiger King is not an uplifting object to gather around as we sink further into the gloom of isolation. But it is riveting, and well worth a watch: a tale of caged things that is, nonetheless, pretty wild.",fresh
81,"Tiger King is Netflix comfort food of the highest order: it immerses viewers in a mind-boggling lifestyle and series of scandals, and yet the term 'true-crime' doesn't do justice to its greatness.",fresh
82,"Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness lives up to its title. It's attention-grabbing, engaging, a little confusing, and a bit too long.",fresh
83,"Whatever flaws it might have, Tiger King is a series that viewers, especially quarantined viewers who might be feeling a little caged themselves, will tear into like a liger into a pile of expired luncheon meat from Walmart.",fresh
84,This show feels like Florida man unchained.,fresh
